# Data Preprocessing:

# identify and treating of Missing Values.

data.isnull().sum()

# data.dropna()

# Mean,Median--> filling of missing values.

# Dropping all the records of missing Values---> dropna().

# Check Duplicate records and  simply have the Unique records to be included into your dataset:

# Correlation Matrix

data.corr()

#- 1 to 1

# Positive Coreleation: relationship of Variable in Moving in Same direction

# Negative Corelation: relationship existing in inverse manner: one variable is increasing, other variable is decreasing.Vice-versa.

# No correlation or Zero : there is no existing relationship between the two variable.

# attrition rate: number of employee left/ number of total employees.

# Understanding

# People with low project as well as people with more number will have higher chance of churning out of the company.

# Salary : incentives based system to be introduced.

# Drill Report : Dash(web hosting), plotly

# Power BI, Tableau

# Model which help me to predict the churning out of the employee from the company .
